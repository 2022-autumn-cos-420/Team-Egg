accessLevel is used to determine the actions and visibility of elements on the site.

If you're using firebaseRules.txt to set your database permissions for security, at minimum you must have at least
an accessLevel of 4 to add courses to the course document.

So far that's the only limiting factor but this accessLevel gives some flexiability to allow several different accessLevels
to limit course addition, review removal, course removal, etc.
