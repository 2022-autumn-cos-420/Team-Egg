Mission Statement:
Class is hard, let's not make it harder.

Team Egg is committed to promoting academic well-being and success among students through the harsh environments of university. 
Our program offers a wide variety of tools for students to help and inform each other such as, study groups, professional assistance, and course evaluation.

After-all, we could all use an egg in these trying times.


Problem Statement:
When selecting a course there seems to be a common problem that most students find themselves in the dark when first picking a class. Most of what you can rely on as a student when selecting a course is things you have heard from peers who might’ve already taken it. Students may find it difficult to blindly walk into an elective they don't know much about, commit to the course and credits, then find themselves wanting to drop after they realize the course isn't what they thought. 
Advisors can always give out advice regarding course loads and descriptions but they can only offer their perspective from an advisor or instructor position most of the time. Students who have recently taken the course have a fresher experience, but there is currently no avenue of unsolicited course advice freely available for fellow peers. How can a system be designed to have students relay information to their peers concerning courses with a lack of initial understanding?
