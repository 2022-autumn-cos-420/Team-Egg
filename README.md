## Problem Statement
Students often lack the information and skills to choose classes that teach interesting material in a way that is well received given what they know, their other time commitments, and what teaching strategies work best for them. It’s difficult for a student to walk into an elective they don't know much about. It’s possible to find themselves committing to the course and credits, then wanting to drop when they realize the course is far more complicated, overwhelming, or subject matter not suited to their learning style (Online classes, synchronous, asynchronous, etc). 

Dropping courses can lead to severe consequences such as;

- Losing a scholarship that requires you take a certain number of credit hours if you are unable to replace the dropped course due to class availability or scheduling conflict.
- Losing money spent on the course if dropped after the refund date.
- A black mark on your GPA if dropped with a withdrawal-fail.
- Falling behind on your degree and needing to make it up on a later semester or be forced to take another semester before graduating.

To make well informed decisions, a student could find another student like them who took the class, but existing solutions don’t facilitate that. Advisors give out advice regarding course loads and descriptions but they can only offer their perspective from an advisor or instructor position which can be insufficient for the specific student’s needs. How can we build a reliable and organized student-led knowledge-base regarding difficulty, pacing, work load, enjoyment, and relevancy to solve the ignorance students are experiencing when picking a course?
