## Problem Statement
Students may find it difficult to blindly walk into an elective they don't know much about, commit to the course and credits, then find themselves wanting to drop after they realize the course isn't what they thought. 

Dropping courses can lead to severe consequences such as; 
- Losing a scholarship that requires you take a certain number of credit hours if you are unable to replace the dropped course due to class availability or scheduling conflict.
- Losing money spent on the course if dropped after the refund date.
- A black mark on your GPA if dropped with a withdrawal-fail.
- Falling behind on your degree and needing to make it up on a later semester or be forced to take another semester before graduating.

Advice or experiences youâ€™ve heard from peers who have already taken the course are usually what you have to rely on. Advisors can always give out advice regarding course loads and descriptions but they can only offer their perspective from an advisor or instructor position most of the time. How can we build a reliable and organized knowledgebase of student feedback that other students can search through without having to personally know each other?
